# SMS-Importer
App for Android that helps to import SMS, that was backuped by PC Companion powered by Sony.

Prehistory

The main problem that this app is solving is: when you have backup with you data made by PC Companion, and then you downgrade you android.
PC Companion wouldn't restore backup. As for I had Android 5 and wanted to downgrade to 4.4. I have made backup, migrated to 4.4 and tryed to restore backup.
But PC Companion didn't do it. As i understand the problem of different structure of sms/mms database. That is why I'm trying to make some app that help to import
your sms/mms data.

Usage

1) Copy mmssms.db to the phone <br>
2) Lauch Importer app <br>
3) Select db by pressing Import button<br>
4) Press Strart Button <br>
5) Wait until import will be done. <br>
